## 

What is the 3-Day Cardiac Diet?

The 3-Day Cardiac Diet is said to boost weight loss and enhance [heart health](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/heart-healthy-foods).

Also known as the Birmingham Diet, it’s rumored to have been developed at the University of Alabama-Birmingham, although there’s no evidence to support this. Some say it was created to help people with heart disease lose weight before surgery.

Proponents claim that it can help you [lose up to 10 pounds](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/lose-10-pounds-in-one-week) (4.5 kg) in just 3 days.

### How to follow it

The plan sets strict rules for which foods you should consume for 3 consecutive days during the week. During the remaining 4 days, you can enjoy whichever foods you’d like.

This cycle should be repeated at the beginning of the next week as many times as necessary until you reach your goal weight.

The meal plan provides detailed information about which foods to eat at which meals, as well as the amounts of each food permitted. During the 3 days, no other ingredients are allowed, nor can any substitutions can be made.

Meals revolve primarily around toast and a source of protein. The [calorie count](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/how-many-calories-per-day) is extremely low, at 800–1,000 calories per day.

The diet sets no guidelines for lifestyle changes, such as [physical activity](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/10-benefits-of-exercise) or hydration.

> The 3-Day Cardiac Diet requires dieters to follow a strict meal plan for 3 consecutive days and a normal diet for the remainder of the week.

## 

Foods to eat (and avoid)

The 3-Day Cardiac Diet sets strict limits on foods you can eat during specific meals. Meals generally consist of a protein source paired with fruits, vegetables, toast, or saltine crackers.

Salt and pepper are the only permitted spices. For dessert, vanilla ice cream is allowed once per day during dinner.

No other ingredients or substitutions are allowed.

The foods you can eat on the 3-Day Cardiac Diet are:

  * **Fruit:** grapefruit, bananas, melons, and apples
  * **Vegetables:** turnip greens, string beans, carrots, cauliflower, [beets](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/heart-healthy-foods), cabbage, and broccoli
  * **Dairy products:** vanilla ice cream, cottage cheese, and Cheddar cheese
  * **Proteins:** tuna, eggs, skinless poultry, [peanut butter](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/is-peanut-butter-bad-for-you), and lean cuts of beef and pork
  * **Grains:** toast and saltine crackers
  * **Beverages:** black coffee, tea, water, and diet soda



If a food doesn’t appear in the list above, you can assume that it’s banned on the diet.

> **summary**

> The 3-Day Cardiac Diet limits you to a tiny selection of fruits, vegetables, dairy products, proteins, and grains.

## 

Does it aid weight loss or heart health?

The 3-Day Cardiac Diet claims to help you drop 10 pounds (4.5 kg) quickly while improving heart health.

### Weight loss

Because the diet is very restrictive and limits the amount of food you can eat, it’s very low in calories and may lead to short-term weight loss.

Keep in mind that almost any diet with a daily calorie count of 800–1,000 will lead to a drop in body weight. That’s because you’d be consuming fewer calories than your body burns, which would result in weight loss.

However, [cutting calories too much](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/calorie-restriction-risks) may lead to side effects like hunger, nausea, headaches, and fatigue ([1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK278991/)).

Furthermore, the diet’s restrictions only apply for 3 days of the week. You eat a normal diet during the other 4 days, meaning that [your weight may fluctuate widely](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/yo-yo-dieting).

As such, the diet may be unsustainable in the long run and lead to weight regain once you resume a normal diet. That’s because it fails to promote long-term lifestyle changes or healthy eating habits ([2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4334025/), [3](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK221839/)).

### Heart health

Although no evidence supports the notion that the 3-Day Cardiac Diet benefits heart health, it limits most [processed foods](https://www.healthline.com/health/food-nutrition/processed-foods-to-avoid), which may be beneficial.

That said, while it cuts out most processed and high sugar foods, it allows large portions of ice cream, beef franks, white bread, and diet soda, all of which have been linked to adverse cardiovascular outcomes ([4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4446768/), [5](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4597475/), [6](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5708308/), [7](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24493081/), [8](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6470727/), [9](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26621069/)).

According to a large study in over 105,000 people, those who ate more ultra-processed foods had a higher risk of [heart disease](https://www.healthline.com/health/heart-disease) over an average of 5 years ([10](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6538975/)).

Still, the 3-Day Cardiac Diet is only followed for short bursts, with no guidelines for what to eat during the rest of the week. Thus, additional research is needed to determine how other components of the diet may affect heart health.

> **summary**
> 
> Although the 3-Day Cardiac Diet may lead to short-term weight loss and limits many processed foods, its short-term, restrictive nature likely nullifies these benefits.

## 

Downsides and side effects

The 3-Day Cardiac Diet is linked to several potential downsides and side effects.

### Limited research

One of the biggest drawbacks of the 3-Day Cardiac Diet is that very little evidence supports it.

No solid studies back its claims that you can lose 10 pounds (4.5 kg) rapidly or improve heart health on this diet. In fact, it eliminates many foods that support heart health, including [whole grains](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/9-benefits-of-whole-grains) and many fruits, vegetables, and legumes ([11](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28840462/)).

This eating plan can be classified as a [crash diet](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/do-diets-make-you-gain-weight) that isn’t based on sound science.

### Highly restrictive

The 3-Day Cardiac Diet includes a very limited selection of foods in small amounts.

Substitutions aren’t permitted, making the diet difficult to follow if you have any dietary restrictions or particular food preferences. It may also be challenging for adventurous eaters or those who enjoy experimenting in the kitchen.

Furthermore, you may run the risk of [nutrient deficiencies](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/7-common-nutrient-deficiencies) if you follow several cycles of the diet, especially because the diet cannot be tailored to people with different body sizes, activity levels, or nutritional needs.

Remember that the diet provides an average of 800–1,000 calories per day, which is well below the amount that most adults need ([6](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK499909/)).

This can not only leave you feeling hungry but also cause you to experience fatigue, [nausea](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/nausea-remedies), and headaches ([1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK278991/)).

### Tedious and hard to follow

The 3-Day Cardiac Diet requires that you carefully measure foods and adhere to strict guidelines, which may be difficult and time-consuming.

Additionally, it’s highly restrictive and doesn’t offer any flexibility, which can encumber social situations, travel, and family meals.

Furthermore, some of these restrictions may promote an [unhealthy relationship with food](https://www.healthline.com/health/eating-disorders/anxiety-about-food).

Thus, it’s likely more challenging to maintain in the long run, compared with [other eating plans](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/best-diet-plans).

> **Summary**
> 
> The 3-Day Cardiac Diet is highly restrictive, dangerous, and difficult to follow. Plus, it isn’t backed by research.

## 

Sample 3-day menu

The 3-Day Cardiac Diet provides strict food and meal composition guidelines.

Keep in mind that no substitutions or additional ingredients are permitted. Salt and pepper are allowed, but other seasonings, herbs, and spices aren’t.

You can drink black coffee or tea with breakfast, while diet soda is allowed in some variations of the diet.

Here is a sample meal plan for the 3-Day Cardiac Diet:

###  Day 1

  * **Breakfast:** half of a [grapefruit](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/10-benefits-of-grapefruit) or juice and 1 slice of toast with 1 tablespoon (16 grams) of peanut butter
  * **Lunch:** 1 slice of toast with 1/2 cup (73 grams) of tuna
  * **Dinner:** 3 ounces (85 grams) of lean meat, 1 cup (180 grams) of cooked string beans, 1 cup (130 grams) of carrots or beets, 1 small [apple](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/10-health-benefits-of-apples), and 1 cup (150 grams) of vanilla ice cream



### Day 2

  * **Breakfast:** 1 hard-boiled egg, 1 slice of toast, and half of a banana
  * **Lunch:** 1 cup (225 grams) of [cottage cheese](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/cottage-cheese-is-super-healthy) or 1/2 cup (73 grams) of tuna and 5 saltine crackers 
  * **Dinner:** 2 beef franks, 1 cup (90 grams) of cooked [cabbage](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/benefits-of-cabbage) or broccoli, 1/2 cup (65 grams) of turnip greens or carrots, half of a banana, and 1/2 cup (75 grams) of vanilla ice cream



### Day 3

  * **Breakfast:** 1 [hard-boiled egg](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/boiled-egg-nutrition) and 1 slice of toast
  * **Lunch:** 1 ounce (28 grams) of Cheddar cheese, 1 small apple, and 5 saltine crackers
  * **Dinner:** 1 cup (146 grams) of tuna, 1 cup (100 grams) of cooked string beans or [cauliflower](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/benefits-of-cauliflower), 1 cup (130 grams) of carrots or beets, 1 cup (160 grams) of melon, and 1/2 cup (75 grams) of vanilla ice cream

> The sample menu above details some of the 3-Day Cardiac Diet’s limited meal options.

## 

The bottom line

The 3-Day Cardiac Diet is geared toward people looking for an easy way to [lose weight](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/how-to-lose-weight-as-fast-as-possible) and improve their heart health.

However, it’s not only unsupported by research but also associated with a slew of potential side effects. It dangerously restricts calories, may promote unhealthy eating habits, and possibly lead to weight regain over time.

Instead, a [well-rounded diet](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/healthy-eating-for-beginners) rich in nutritious ingredients is a better option for improved heart health and weight management. For best results, be sure to pair your diet with a healthy lifestyle and regular physical activity.

# Your 3-Day Heart-Healthy Meal Plan: 1,200 Calories

Plus 6 ways a heart dietitian can help you

![Closeup of cottage cheese and pineapple](https://assets.clevelandclinic.org/transform/LargeFeatureImage/253057b9-f87b-441a-a745-1fe2709f9005/1200Diet-117996751-770x553_jpg)

Have diabetes or hypertension raised your risk of heart disease, or do you simply want to eat in a more heart-healthy way? A three-day meal plan can help. This 1,200 calorie-a-day plan can help most women lose weight, says [Julia Zumpano, RD, LD](http://my.clevelandclinic.org/departments/heart/depts/preventive-cardiology-rehabilitation?dFR%5bsearchCollections%5d%5b0%5d=154&_ga=1.65343982.1516478930.1486753311#tab-6).

### **6 ways a heart dietitian will help you**

When you have high blood pressure, diabetes or excess weight, your doctor may refer you to a heart dietitian.

“Our goal is to reduce your cardiac risk,” explains Zumpano. “We try to get you started and educate you so that you’re empowered to make ‘good’ versus ‘bad’ food choices.”

When you see a heart dietitian, you will learn how to:

**1.Distinguish nutrient-dense foods from empty-calorie foods.**

  * The [Mediterranean diet](https://health.clevelandclinic.org/how-to-get-started-on-the-mediterranean-diet-aka-the-healthiest-diet-for-your-heart/) is loaded with nutrient-dense foods, packed with vitamins, minerals, fiber and/or healthy fat: fresh produce; nuts, seeds and olive oil; beans and whole grains; and lean proteins.
  * The typical American diet contains too many high-calorie foods devoid of nutrients: soda, chips, crackers, cookies and candy bars. They add to your weight, and raise your blood sugar and bad LDL cholesterol levels.



**2. Choose healthy versus unhealthy fats.**

  * Healthy (unsaturated) fats don’t turn solid at room temperature, and include plant oils, nuts, olives, avocado and fatty fish.
  * Saturated fats turn solid at room temperature. “While there’s room for some saturated fat in our diets, we want to limit meat and keep solid animal fat, like chicken skin, marbled cuts and bacon, to a minimum,” she says.
  * Start [replacing red meat](https://health.clevelandclinic.org/link-between-red-meat-and-heart-health-happens-in-the-gut-study-finds/) with poultry or fish, and full-fat dairy with plant-based options like olive oil and nuts. Try making one meatless meal per week using beans or legumes.
  * Manmade fats ([trans fat](https://health.clevelandclinic.org/why-trans-fats-are-bad-for-you/)/partially hydrogenated oils), also solid at room temperature, have been banned by the FDA. “They increase bad cholesterol and usually cause weight gain and inflammation,” she notes.



**3. Tell healthy carbs from unhealthy carbs.**

  * [High-fiber carbs](https://health.clevelandclinic.org/complex-carbs-which-starches-still-belong-in-your-diet/) (like whole grains and legumes) are always better than simple carbs, like sweets, snack foods, chips, and white bread, pasta or rice.
  * Every meal should include lots of veggies, and some fruit or whole grain. “Watch your grain portions,” cautions Zumpano. “I recommend three 15-gram servings of carbs per day — for example, ½ cup oatmeal, 1 slice of bread and ½ cup of brown rice.”
  * If you have diabetes and need to lose weight, limit your carbs to 2 to 3 grams per meal (for women) and 3 to 4 grams of carbs (for men). This will also keep your blood sugars stable.



4. **Eat at home more often.**

  * [Restaurant meals](https://health.clevelandclinic.org/how-to-eat-healthy-at-your-favorite-restaurants/) are often high in salt and saturated fat. If you’re eating out five days a week, “we’ll troubleshoot why you’re doing this so often and try to find some quick, easy options that you can make at home instead,” says Zumpano.
  * Can’t give up eating at restaurants? Work on doing so four, or three, days a week instead. Avoid dishes that are fried, creamed, buttered or tempura, and opt for baked, boiled or broiled foods instead.



**5. Get a handle on your snacking.**

  * Snacks should have no more than 15 or 20 grams of carbohydrate. (One carb serving is 15 carbs, two is 30, etc.).
  * Include a protein and complex carb in each snack.
  * Choose healthy snacks that suit your taste buds (e.g., replace sweets with fruit and nuts, and salty chips with whole grain crackers and cheese).

**6. Reduce the salt in your diet.**

  * Always read food labels for sodium content, and if you have hypertension or prehypertension, [limit yourself](https://health.clevelandclinic.org/are-salt-substitutes-a-healthy-way-to-lower-your-sodium-intake/) to 1,500 milligrams (about 2/3 teaspoon) of salt per day.
  * When eating out, avoid the American Heart Association’s “salty six” (foods that increase blood pressure): pizza, poultry, deli meats, canned soups, breads and sandwiches.



“We can show you how to make changes in the way you eat so that you can follow a heart-healthy diet and not even have to think about it,” says Zumpano.

# The 3-Day Meal Plan

By[Rachel Lessenden](https://healthmylifestyle.com/about/) Published:April 29, 2017August 3, 2021 Updated:August 3, 2021

[6 Comments](#comments)

It’s here! I am so excited to share what I’ve been working on for all of you. This meal plan is jam-packed with recipes that, honestly, will last you more than a few days because we like cooking enough for several days. BUT I decided you deserved variety because not everyone knows that there are a plethora of delicious whole food, plant-based recipes out there, so I wanted to showcase some of my favorites.

This post may contain affiliate links. Read my [policy page](https://healthmylifestyle.com/privacy-policy/) for more information. 

Here’s a sneak peek!

![](https://healthmylifestyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/7-Day-Meal-Plan-1.png)[](https://pinterest.com/pin/create/bookmarklet/?media=https%3A%2F%2Fhealthmylifestyle.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2019%2F05%2F7-Day-Meal-Plan-1.png&url=https%3A%2F%2Fhealthmylifestyle.com%2F3-day-meal-plan%2F%3Futm_source%3Dpinterest%26utm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dgrow-social-pro&is_video=false&description=The%203-Day%20Meal%20Plan "Pin this!")

This meal plan includes:

  * 3 days worth of meals⁠—breakfast, lunch, dinner, and snacks that are healthy, whole food, plant-based, and delicious
  * Nutrient breakdown of each meal and daily overview of nutrient intake
  * Easy to make recipes⁠—low prepping and cooking time
  * Done for you shopping list



This meal plan is perfect for weight-loss since it is what you would call a “clean” meal plan but it doesn’t feel like you’re being deprived at all! In fact, most days are around 1700-1800 calories. What’s great about this meal plan is it is easily scalable for your fitness aspirations. Whether it’s losing weight, you can easily reduce serving sizes to be in a calorie-deficit, or increase serving sizes to be in calorie-surplus for muscle building. There is enough protein either way, because as long as you’re eating enough to not feel hungry, you should be eating enough protein. That is the beauty of plant-based eating. No calculating!

BUT I did calculate the micronutrients because I wanted to show you just how nutritious this way of eating is. If you plugged in your food for the day on an omnivore diet I _highly_ doubt you’d get anywhere near what you needed for some of these micronutrients without supplementing or eating something fortified. However, the best way to absorb nutrients is through diet, not through supplementing. Especially since the supplement industry is unregulated⁠—you really don’t know what, or how much, you’re truly getting or able to absorb.

The only nutrient I do supplement for is Vitamin B12. I take the [Jarrow Formulas Methyl B-12 1000 mcg](https://healthmylifestyle.com/shop/). I like their formula because they utilize Methylcobalamin which is better absorbed and retained than other forms of B12. It is also chewable which is best for absorption rather than just swallowing. And the lemon flavor tastes delicious! Plus, it is vegan due to the vegetable sourced compounds. Additionally, I prefer the 1000 mcg dose over anything higher or lower because absorption rates are low, so even if you take 1000 mcg, you may only be absorbing around 40-50 mcg. The recommended intake is 3-5 mcg a day but there is no harm in exceeding the recommended amount for this vitamin. Only intakes above 5000 micrograms per week should be avoided due to lack of evidence for toxicity from higher amounts. I take this every other day to ensure I don’t exceed 5000 mcg a week, but for the sake of hitting all the nutrient targets for the meal plan, I have included the Vitamin B12 supplement daily.

Grab this [free meal plan here](https://healthmylifestyle.com/free-meal-plan/) and it will be sent to your inbox for immediate download. Hope you enjoy it!

If you do follow the meal plan, I would love some feedback! Please share by commenting below, emailing me at healthmylifestyle [at] gmail [dot] com, or tagging me on Instagram @healthmylifestyle
